Linking logic is now done. Now we need to do the following fixes:

1. Cleanup & refactor
1. Output should be formatted nicely (add JS and CSS files)
1. Write a better index.md page with links to some good articles.
1. A link should only appear once per page. If the link has appeared already in this page, don't interpolate it again.
1. Document titles should be dynamically defined
1. Favicon
