<p><strong>Key realization: The dev job application process is the same as the sales <a href="/wiki/careers/funnel.md">funnel</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In sales, there is a concept called the sales <a href="/wiki/careers/funnel.md">funnel</a> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code> \         Cold emails      /
  \         Meetings       /
   \        Proposals     /
    \         Sales      /
     \    Repeat Buyer  /
</code></pre>
<p>The good salesperson knows that she can lose a prospective customer at any step in this sales process. There is a percentage probability that a potential sale will fall through at any time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the good salesperson tries to maximize the number of sales by doing as many cold calls as she can (or emails, or LinkedIn messages, etc.). This is called "filling the sales <a href="/wiki/careers/funnel.md">funnel</a>".</p>
<p>But this is not the only way to maximize sales. Sales (and repeat buyers) can also be increased by optimizing each step of the process. This way, she can improve the number of customers that "convert" from one step to the next. This is called "improving conversion rates". For example, by working on her PowerPoint deck, the salesperson can make more customers pass from the "Meetings" step to the "Proposals" step. By offering discounts or improving the wording on her proposal documents, she can help more customers move from "Proposals" to "Sales".</p>
<h2>The job application <a href="/wiki/careers/funnel.md">funnel</a> (JAF)</h2>
<p>When applying to software development jobs, the <a href="/wiki/careers/funnel.md">funnel</a> still applies. Here are the new steps:</p>
<pre><code> \      Job applications     /
  \     Phone interviews    /
   \    Technical tests    /
    \   In-person tests   /
     \    Job offers     /
</code></pre>
<p>We'll call this the "Job Application Funnel", or "JAF" for short.</p>
<p>At each step, the jobseeker has a chance of being rejected. For example, if his verbal communication is sub-par, he might not have a very high conversion rate at the Phone Interview step. If his technical skills are not very strong, he might not pass the "Technical test" or "In-person test" very often, even if he is landing them all the time.</p>
<h2>How to pass each step</h2>
<p><strong>Key realization: Passing each step is a separate and mostly independent challenge.</strong></p>
<p>At each step, the company looks for very different attributes from the jobseeker. Here is a breakdown:</p>
<p><strong>Job Application</strong> - to consistently pass this step and start getting more phone interviews, your resume must be excellent and you must have a great Github and LinkedIn. An excellent social media presence also helps, so make sure you clean up how you look on Google.</p>
<p><strong>Phone Interviews</strong> - to consistently pass this step and start getting more technical tests, you must have a rudimentary understanding of software development and at least passable social skills. Getting through this step is largely a process of getting rejected again and again until you "get it right". Working on your speaking skills can help; try googling <code>Toastmasters</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Technical tests</strong> - for this step, having very strong technical skills is the only requirement to pass. Writing correct, clean, and efficient code will help you pass. There is also an unfortunate tendency to present developers with algorithm tests and Big-O efficiency optimization tests -- these are quite stupid and unreliable indicators of performance for most dev jobs, but you should be prepared to answer these. Doing <a href="https://mintbean.io">Mintbean</a> hackathons frequently will help a lot with this step, as will <code>HackerRank</code> and <code>CodeWars</code>.</p>
<p><strong>In-person tests</strong> - This is very much like the <code>Technical tests</code> step, except because this is in-person, you will have to look and sound the part. This step requires solid technical skills and medium-strength communication skills. The interviewer will be looking for soft skills as well as hard skills. Dressing appropriately, practicing personal hygiene, and working on your verbal skills will help. Doing <a href="https://mintbean.io">Mintbean</a> interviews will help tremendously, since I have designed these hackathons to be about as close to "real world" scenarios as you will get without having a real job. Developing a hobby around coding will help a lot, too.</p>
<p><strong>Job offers</strong> - Your work isn't quite done. After you get the job offer, you must <em>keep</em> the job. I personally recommend working at least 60 to 80 hours per week in your probation period to make sure you hit the mark. This step is a process of optics and teamwork skills, in addition to technical skills.</p>
